The purposes of this document
================================================================

Halide already has a `tutorial <https://halide-lang.org/tutorials/tutorial_introduction.html>`_ that detailedly explains the syntax of the language and the basics of scheduling. This document is an alternative to the official tutorial, that serves several purposes:

- It is a more lightweight introduction to Halide about what it can do and how to do it, with less focus on the scheduling language, assuming the autoscheduler can provide an efficient schedule.

- It shows real Halide code examples and provides explanation on them, so that the readers can have a better understanding of Halide's capability.

- It shows how to incorporate learning components in Halide programs, and how Halide interacts with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
